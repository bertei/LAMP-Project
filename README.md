# RossxRoss LAMP Project Documentation

## Overview

Initiative born out of the [rossxross DevOps Bootcamp 2023](https://github.com/roxsross/bootcamp-devops-2023/tree/clase2-linux-bash/app-295devops-travel), aimed at automating the deployment of a complete LAMP stack. This documentation provides an insight into the project's components, objectives, and the technology stack employed to achieve automation.

## Project Description

The primary goal of the LAMP Project is to automate the setup of a LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP) web server stack on AWS infrastructure. This includes the creation of a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) and an Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instance. The automation is achieved through the utilization of Terraform for infrastructure provisioning and configuration, and GitHub Actions for continuous integration and deployment.

## Key Components

1. **Terraform:** Terraform is used to define and create the necessary AWS infrastructure for the LAMP stack. The Terraform configuration files can be found in this repository.

2. **AWS Infrastructure:** The project provisions an AWS VPC and deploys an EC2 instance within it. This EC2 instance is where the LAMP stack will be installed.

3. **GitHub Actions:** GitHub Actions is employed to automate the Terraform deployment process. This ensures a consistent and reliable deployment pipeline for the project.
